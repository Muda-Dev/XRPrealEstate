# RealEstate Token Offering Platform

This project implements a platform for interacting with regulated asset-backed digital assets known as security tokens (STOs). The platform allows users to tokenize tangible assets, enabling entrepreneurs to raise capital and investors to access secure alternative investments. This README provides instructions for running the Python code and a brief overview of the concept.

## Concept

The platform enables asset owners to register physical assets on the blockchain and issue security tokens representing ownership rights, revenue shares, and potential voting rights. Token holders are entitled to legal ownership, revenue distribution, and transparent accountability through smart contracts. The project aims to provide liquidity and accessibility to asset-backed STOs.
